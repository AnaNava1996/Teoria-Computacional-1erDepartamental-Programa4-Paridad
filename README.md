Deterministic Finite Automata

This program analyzes a string of 0's and 1's, manually or automatically, and tells you if the 
string have the same number of 0's than 1's. Also. It works with an automata 

In the screenshot(26) you can see how the automata works, and in the screenshot(27), you can see the txt file with all the states of the automata
